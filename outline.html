I want to let some of my thoughts be public.

They should be bilingual, ie both English and Mandarin.

References are required, including hyperlinks, geolocation,
and, of course, pictures.

All of them would go with my comment.

Topics

The 1st one is about food.

Most of foreigner misunderstand what is the delicious in Taiwan.
I want to tell them the fact in my opinion.

In Taiwan, there are lots of special dishes, 改良品種的食材和水果, etc.
I want to list and describe them with my comment,
and provide information such as where and how I get it
including recipe and where I buy the recipe.

~~~~~~~~

The 2nd thing is list of daily information from government.

An example is 衛福部的停班停課通知.
Another includes 年度納稅, 繳交健保勞保, etc.

Against this section, the point is "which should we care in our daily life
while we live in Taiwan as a citizen".

~~~~~~~~

Following the 2nd, obviously we don't really know what the government is doing. So that's the thing we should investigate.

The result may include the organization of the Taiwan government, their main track, what they target to resolve, and corresponding law and budgets updated ... a huge topic.

~~~~~~~~

When we learnt more about government, there are also lots of information they tried to publish to citizen, although Taiwanese is too stupid to pay attention.

In this section, I attempt to integrate government information sources to be a kind of monitor.

~~~~~~~~

Such monitor may not really useful because of low quality sources, therefore, it also considers sources come from government opendata, yet another big topic, such as 水情, 固定測速照相地點, 氣象, etc.

I image that, with such powerful monitor, it gives me whole picture of my country, btw.

~~~~~~~~

When live in Taiwan, there are lots of "disinformation attack" around us.

I want to monitor news from CNA and clarifications from government.
